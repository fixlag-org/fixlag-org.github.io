  <h1>fixsig | The Symbolic Poem of Time Lag Laboratory</h1>
  <pre>◢◤◥◣
◥◢◣◤</pre>
  <p>This symbol is composed of only eight characters, yet it richly represents the philosophy of fixlag.org.</p>
  <p>The outer structures "◢◤◥◣" and "◥◢◣◤" are symmetrical yet misaligned, visually expressing lag, contradiction, and the gap between ideals and reality.</p>
  <p>What emerges in the center is an upward arrow "↑", or an abstract image of a person quietly rising.</p>
  <p>This fixsig symbolizes the will to rise from misalignment, the growth that dwells in waiting, and the sincerity of a human standing tall within constraints.</p>
  <p>By attaching this symbol to email signatures, documents, websites, or business cards, we hope to quietly connect with those who resonate with our philosophy.</p>
