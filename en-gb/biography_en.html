  <p>SHOICHI SATO was born in Meguro, Tokyo, and studied Management System Design at Tokyo Metropolitan University (formerly Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Technology), where he pursued a fusion of engineering and human-centered design.</p>

  <p>His specialties include management information theory, operations management, labor time evaluation models, and the task analysis and design for effective use of equipment and systems. He focuses particularly on understanding and applying behaviors in systems and operations involving "time lags."</p>

  <p>Recent research includes the placement of mobile high-performance generators ("mobile reactors") and the use of Teams-based remote VC environments, aiming to visualize and redesign operational procedures.</p>
