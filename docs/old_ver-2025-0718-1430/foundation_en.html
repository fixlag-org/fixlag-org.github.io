  <h1>Establishment Note | Time Lag Laboratory</h1>
  <p>We humans live, judge, and act within limited time. Yet in real society, organizations, and nature, we always face "lags" between ideals and reality, thoughts and outcomes. These lags are often seen as obstacles to be eliminated.</p>
  <p>But we want to reconsider: perhaps there is essential meaning within the lag. Rather than remove it, can we observe it, understand it, and live with it?</p>
  <p>fixlag is not merely about correcting delayâ€”it is about embracing the significance of time differences in growth, decision, feeling, and control. It is a human endeavor to design, adjust, and accept lags as part of life.</p>
  <p>This "laboratory" is a place for people who face evolving phenomena and unanswered questions with passion. We believe that wisdom and virtue thrive not in perfect systems, but in the incomplete spaces between them.</p>
  <p>We cherish sincerity, collaboration, time sensitivity, and human virtue. The lags we study are not only technical but also emotional, social, and internal.</p>
  <p>We hope this site becomes a quiet light for those walking earnestly with their own lag.</p>
